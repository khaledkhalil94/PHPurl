Install

1. Upload the files to your host.

ATTENTION! The .htaccess file is always placed in the root folder, Even if you place the main files in a subfolder. However, you can offer redirection from a sub-folder (yourdomain.com/sub-folder/shorturl.)

If you install it to a subfolder you have to edit the .htaccess file.

The line:

"RewriteRule ^([a-zA-Z0-9]+)/?$ /go.php?id=$1 [L]"
To
"RewriteRule ^([a-zA-Z0-9]+)/?$ /subfolder/go.php?id=$1 [L]"

2. Open up config.php . Edit the lines with the correct information for your Domain Name and Mysql info, and admin username and password.

ATTENTION! You can only specify the domain name, even if you placed the main files in a subfolder. Again, this also has a stipulation is you want to offer redirection from a sub-folder (yourdomain.com/sub-folder/shorturl.)


3. Run install.php it will create the tables, Remember to delete install.php  when its finished.
